# This section force the binding of containers port to the host machine. It is then used in /etc/hosts of each container
hosts: 
  default:
    ip: "127.0.0.1" # this config has no meaning, it just to force the port mapping (we choose localhost to add an /etc/hosts rule without impact)
    targets:
      - "localhost"
