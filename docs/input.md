BNC takes as input 4 type of files:

    * config-deploy.yaml: This input file contains the description of the organization itself. It is used to start orderers/peers containers.
    
    * config-genesis.yaml: This input file contains the description of the initial consortium organizations. It is used to generate the genesis block and the channel definition.
    
    * config-hosts.yaml: This file is used to interconnect containers of different organizations between each other.
    
    * config-chaincode.yaml: This input file is used each time a chaincode is deployed using BNC. It contains the chaincode configuration (e.g. path to chaincode/ name/ version/ target peers)
