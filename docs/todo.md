# Hot Actions items:

- [ ] finalize and test channel integration code
- [ ] finalize and integrate anchortx generation
- [ ] test multi-host support through docker-compose extra-host field
- [ ] check file before creating new one (docker-compose, msp, artifacts...)
- [ ] refactor files (remove dockercomposeyamloptions class and use network model class instead) 
- [ ] add e2e & unit test file 


#### Issues:

 - [ ] check if ca container is running and fabric_ca folder and files exists
 - [ ] auto-stop container of peers and orderers if redeploy action is triggered
 - [ ] check docker container status once deployed (check if not exited)
