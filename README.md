# bnc-hlf

Blockchain Network Composer for Hyperledger Fabric.
BNC is the CLI deployment tools for Enterprise Blockchain projects.
It supports mainly Hyperledger Blockchain umbrella.

Using BNC everyone can easily:
    
* Start a network with a configured number of organizations/peers/orderers.

* Deploy, configure and channels
    
* Deploy, configure and upgrade chaincodes 
    
* Add a new organization or a new orderer to the network

## Prerequisites

[Install docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04-fr)

[Install docker-compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04-fr)

## Install

````aidl
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxforce/bnc-hlf/improve-docs/bin/bnc -o /usr/local/bin/bnc && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bnc
````


## Getting Started :rocket:


### Run default demo

The following command will start a network of a single orderer _orderer1.bnc.com_ , a single peer _peer1.org1.bnc.com_ and a certificate authority _ca1_.

It will also deploy the default chaincode  which is the [abstore chaincode](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/main/chaincode/abstore) of fabric-samples.

To start the network run the following command:


````aidl
bnc run
````

By running the command above without specifying `--config-folder $PWD` it will take the default [config files](https://github.com/bxforce/bnc-hlf/tree/master/tests/demo).

We will see how you can use `--config-folder` to provide your own configuration files.

**Shutdown network:**

The following command will remove all containers and remove the related volumes.


````aidl
bnc rm
````

### Run your own configuration 

#### Step1: Create config files

````aidl
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxforce/bnc-hlf/master/tests/single_machine/config.yaml > config.yaml
````

#### Step2: Build and run your app 

````aidl
bnc run --config-folder $PWD 
````

The command above will start a single organization with single peer and orderer.

It will deploy the default absotre chaincode embedded in the image.

**Shutdown network:**

````aidl
bnc rm --config-folder $PWD
````

### Run and configure your own chaincode

In this section we will explain how to provide your own chaincode.

We will be running a single org on a single machine.

#### Step1: Create config files

````aidl
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxforce/bnc-hlf/master/tests/single_machine/config.yaml > config.yaml
````

#### Step2: Configure your own chaincode

Open the config.yaml file in the config directory with your favorite editor.

In the chaincode section, notice we have this attribute `root_path_chaincode: "volume_chaincode"`

Instead of `_volume_chaincode_` put the absolute path to the folder e.g. `root_path_chaincode: "/home/ubuntu/bnc-hlf/tests/chaincode/"`

Notice we have : _path_chaincode: "abstore"_ which is the folder containing your .go files.

Notice we have : _lang_chaincode_ if chaincode is in golang leave it to "golang", if it is in nodeJS put: "node"

You can override the default chaincode configuration by passing the flag _-c_ as we will show later


#### Step3: Build and run your app

The following command will start the network and deploy the chaincode

````aidl
bnc run --config-folder $PWD
````

If you want to start your network first, and deploy your chaincode seperately, you can do it like this:

````aidl
bnc run  --config-folder $PWD --no-chaincode
````

````aidl
bnc chaincode deploy --config-folder $PWD
````

Otherwise you can override the default [chaincode configuration](https://github.com/bxforce/bnc-hlf/blob/improve-docs/tests/single_machine/config-chaincode.yaml):

````aidl
bnc chaincode deploy --config-folder $PWD -c config-chaincode.yaml
````

#### Step4: Check if its working

````aidl
docker ps
````

You should be able to see running the orderers/peers configured in the _config.yaml_ file and most importantly you

should be able to see the _dev-peer_ containers of your chaincode.

If you want to test your chaincode do the following: (this is testing fabric-samples abstore)



 ````shell script
bnc chaincode invoke --config-folder $PWD -i "Init,a,100,b,100"
````

query chaincode 

 ````shell script
bnc chaincode query --config-folder $PWD -i "query,a"
````

call the invoke fct to move 10 from a to b

 ````shell script
bnc chaincode invoke --config-folder $PWD -i "invoke,a,b,10"
````

#### Step5: Shutdown network

The following command will remove all containers and remove the related volumes.

````aidl
bnc rm --config-folder $PWD
````
