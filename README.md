#### Hints - Tests

Before executing the bnc-tool command, you need to run

```shell script
npm link
```

This command will install globally a symlink linking to your project so there's no need
for you to re-run this when you update the code.

One done, you can run the commands (for more information refer the command.ts file):

```shell script
bnc new -f YOUR_CONFIFURATION_FILE
```
