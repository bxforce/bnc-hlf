````aidl
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxforce/bnc-hlf/improve-docs/bin/bnc > bnc && chmod a+x bnc && ./bnc run

curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxforce/bnc-hlf/improve-docs/bin/bnc > bnc && chmod a+x bnc && ./bnc clear
````


## Process overview (two orgs example) :bulb:

In the process below, we illustrate the process of starting a consortium blockchain with two organizations: org1 and org2.

In this scenario, org1 is the organization in charge of creating the genesis block and the channel. 

In order to generate the genesis block and the channel definition, org2 shares its orderers/peers certificates with org1.

These generated artifacts by org1 are shared with org2.
