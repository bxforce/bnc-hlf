Blockchain Network Composer for Hyperledger Fabric.
BNC is the CLI deployment tools for Enterprise Blockchain projects.
It supports mainly Hyperledger Blockchain umbrella.

Using BNC everyone can easily:
    
* Start a network with a configured number of peers/orderers.
    
* Deploy your chaincode
    
* Upgrade your chaincode
    
* Update the endorsement policy of your chaincode
    
* Add a new orderer to your running network.
    
* Add a new organization

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Prerequisites

[Install docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04-fr)

[Install docker-compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04-fr)

## Install

````aidl
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxforce/bnc-hlf/improve-docs/bin/bnc -o /usr/local/bin/bnc && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bnc
````


## Getting Started :rocket:


### Run default demo

The following command will start a network of a single orderer _orderer1.bnc.com_ , a single peer _peer1.org1.bnc.com_ and a ca _ca1_.

I will also deploy the default chaincode which is the abstore chaincode of fabric-samples.

By running the following command without specifying `--config-folder $PWD` it will take the default config files:

[demo files](https://github.com/bxforce/bnc-hlf/tree/master/tests/demo).

We will see how you can use `--config-folder $PWD` to provide your own configuration files.


````aidl
bnc run
````

**Clear BNC:**

The following command will remove all BNC containers and remove the related volumes and the dev-peer images.


````aidl
bnc rm
````

### Run your own configuration 

#### Step1: Create config files

````aidl
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxforce/bnc-hlf/master/tests/single_machine/config.yaml > config.yaml
````

````aidl
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxforce/bnc-hlf/master/tests/single_machine/config-hosts.yaml > config-hosts.yaml
````

#### Step2: Build and run your app with BNC

````aidl
bnc run --config-folder $PWD 
````

The command above will start a single organization with single peer and orderer.

It will deploy the default absotre chaincode embedded in the image.

**Clear BNC:**

````aidl
bnc rm
````

### Run and Configure BNC with your own chaincode

In this section we will explain how to provide your own chaincode.

We will be running a single org on a single machine.

#### Step1: Create config files

````aidl
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxforce/bnc-hlf/master/tests/single_machine/config.yaml > config.yaml
````

````aidl
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxforce/bnc-hlf/master/tests/single_machine/config-hosts.yaml > config-hosts.yaml
````

#### Step2: Configure your own chaincode

Open the config.yaml file in the config directory with your favorite editor.

In the chaincode section, notice we have this attribute `root_path_chaincode: "volume_chaincode"`

Instead of `_volume_chaincode_` put the absolute path to the folder e.g. `root_path_chaincode: "/home/ubuntu/bnc-hlf/tests/chaincode/"`

Notice we have : _path_chaincode: "abstore"_ which is the folder containing your .go files.

Notice we have : _lang_chaincode_ if chaincode is in golang leave it to "golang", if it is in nodeJS put: "node"


#### Step3: Build and run your app with BNC

The following command will start the network and deploy the chaincode

````aidl
bnc run --config-folder $PWD
````

If you want to start your network first, and deploy your chaincode seperately, you can do it like this:

````aidl
bnc run  --config-folder $PWD --no-chaincode
````

````aidl
bnc chaincode deploy --config-folder $PWD
````

**Clear BNC:**

````aidl
bnc rm
````


## Process overview (two orgs example) :bulb:

In the process below, we illustrate the process of starting a consortium blockchain with two organizations: org1 and org2.

In this scenario, org1 is the organization in charge of creating the genesis block and the channel. 

In order to generate the genesis block and the channel definition, org2 shares its orderers/peers certificates with org1.

These generated artifacts by org1 are shared with org2.
